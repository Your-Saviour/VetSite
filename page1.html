      Unity is fast, powerful, and relatively simple to get started with.
      Within unity, we can design models using simple 3D shapes and then we can use scripts written in C# to control and interact with them.
      C# is a powerful language that allows us to accomplish complex tasks, is a popular language, with lots of examples of coding solutions.
      Unityâ€™s ability to package games into executable files provide the end game with a finished look and feel.
      <br />
      <br />
      In my game I have attempted to replicate CO<sub>2</sub> powered drag cars.
      My game is designed to be played by two people, it relises on reaction time to be competitive.
      The game is started by pressing one of the buttons, at that point the game scence will switch to the main scene and the
      camera will start moving around the race cars. This is done to give the players an introduction to the game and excite them visually with models of the real cars.
      During this introduction the cars are produce an idling engine sound.
      Once this is over the start light appear. This consisces of 4 sets of circles which represent starting lights.
      If at anytime one of the
      buttons are pressed before the green light comes on a false start message, appear and the timer will restart.
      Once the lights pop up, a yellow light will go on every two seconds, there are 3 sets of these, there is also an audio
      queue consisting of a beeping sound. After the three sets of yellow lights a green light will come on randomly between 0 and 6 seconds.
      This is done so that players cannot predict the start time, a louder and different sound plays for the green light.
      <br />
      <br />
      When the cars take off the sound changes to a more agressive engine racing sound.
      The camera programmed to follow the winning car, this enables us to see the losing car behind it. This helps create a feeling
       of beating the other players. When the winning car reaches the finish line there are particles that show up
      that represent the colour of the winning car, again this done to clearly show the winner.
      Once both cars reach the end a 4 second timer starts to allow the winner to admire the game, them the game changes
      scenes.
      <br />
      <br />
      The next scence shows the winner only rotating on a raising platform while the camera is set on a
      dolly that moves around wining car. Cheering music plays in the backgroup and there are
       stands filled with people that give the illusion of a crowd making the player feel accomished.
